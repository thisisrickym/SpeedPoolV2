Speed Pool better upload

My friends and I have been playing a game called "speed pool". It's similar to chess with the timer, where
a player can win either by normal methods (sinking all their balls and the 8 ball) or by the other player
running out of time.

We were using chess timer apps, but ran into an issue. If a player was much worse than the other (or purposely
missing shots), that would lead to less overall shots during the game and less time used. Also, with all the 
bad players balls on the table, it would be more dificult for the other player to win the normal way.

Enter the speed pool app. This app has the added benefit of giving the user the option to include a time bonus
for each ball sunk. In this way the advantage of the player that can't make anything is lost.
